## Employment

**Feb 2022 - Present : Machine Learning Engineer @ [Sky](https://www.skygroup.sky/)**
- I play a pivotal role in developing and deploying innovative machine learning solutions in the cloud for diverse challenges. My responsibilities include:
    1) Machine Learning Development:
        - Optimizing algorithms and tuning parameters for object detection, achieving a 10% improvement in accuracy.
        - Creating and deploying Generative AI tools for computer vision tasks (Speech Recognition).
        - Developing knowledge graphs and machine learning models for monitoring fraudulent activities over broadcast networks, focusing on real-world applicability.
    2) Cloud Engineering and Deployment:
        - Participating in the cloud migration strategy, transitioning from VMs to a microservices architecture using Docker and APIs, resulting in a 30% reduction in execution time and enhanced logging management.
        - Conducting code reviews and debugging, ensuring robust and efficient team output, and fostering collaboration within the team.

**June 2018 - Feb 2022 : Data Scientist @ [Wealthype](https://wealthype.ai/it/)**
- I've contributed to the development and management of several machine learning solutions delivered either as services (via API), as products (via Docker), or as consulting projects, following CRISP-DM process in an MLOps infrastructure. Main tasks:
    - Supervised & Unsupervised analysis on structured mixed data
    - Bayesian programming
    - Dataset Enrichment and Simulation
